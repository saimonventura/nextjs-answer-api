## ToDo

**Tasks**

- [x] Set up a Next.js app and commit the code to a public Github repository.

- [ ] Add a homepage that allows the user to type a question and let the UI print the response for that given question using the Micro Answer REST API ([https://m3o.com/answer/](https://m3o.com/answer/)).

- [ ] Take over the *styleguide* of Jurata.ch to build this UI. You can use the browser developer tools to find some corresponding **css** values. Try to really focus on the details, such as typography attributes and distances.

- [x] Install ApolloClient to this web app.

- [ ] Now fetch the answers via ApolloClient and store them in the cache.

- [ ] Make sure the answers are bound in the UI, so that any change in the cache is reflected immediately.

- [ ] The user should be able to set the question as part of the url path and this should return the answer as server-side-rendered html.

- [ ] Add internationalization for two languages. The user should have a way to switch between them.

- [ ] Create a short, but comprehensible README.md, that would allow a 10-year old with a Mac to test your app.
